        <h2>Current pack</h2>
        <p>WolffPack 4.0 for Minecraft 1.18 is under development.</p>
        <h3>Mod List</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To be determined</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Development Principles</h3>
        <p>This pack is intended to be somewhere between a "french vanilla" pack and a standard tech modpack. I am open to mod suggestions, but I do have some ground rules:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>No deprecating vanilla</b> Mods should not make a vanilla mechanic entirely pointless. Some finer points: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Tinkers' Construct's repair mechanic makes vanilla anvils (and by extension all vanilla tools) pointless. There's no reason to use up anvil durability, materials, and xp levels when one could use an equivalent Tinkers' tool and repair using only materials.</li>
                    <li>Journeymap (and related minimap plugins) make vanilla maps useless; but in this case I am still undecided. Vanilla map mechanics are particularly bad.</li>
                    <li>Waypoint features (also part of journeymap) make vanilla beacons free, but the waypoint features are so useful (particularly on a multiplayer server) that perhaps instead we should consider Minecraft to have balanced this feature too heavily end-game.</li>
                    <li>Ore doubling does not count. Mods use more ores than vanilla, so it is appropriate to have ore "go further". Additionally, since Mojang updated ore drops in 1.7 (now raw forms instead of the blocks), the base game supports a form of ore multiplication (via fortune enchants).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>No changing worldgen</b> A world generated in vanilla and in the modpack should mostly be the same. Additional world decorations (e.g. Botania flowers) and ores are ok, but not new biomes/structures/etc.</li>
            <li><b>No duplicate functionality</b> There's no need for Thermal Expansion <i>and</i> Mekanism <i>and</i> IndustrialCraft, etc. I want the modpack to be small and performant. Though since mods often have enormous scope, this guideline can be bent a bit if a mod provides a fun feature unique to it.
        </ol>
